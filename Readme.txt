Contribution of Team Members  :-

Each members of this team have equally given their efforts for finding the efficent output for this assignment program.
Basically, 
           AVINASH PRASAD TELLS THE BEST WAY TO CREATE THE PROGRAM AND HOW,WHERE TO USE THE LOOPS IN THE PROGRAM.
           DHRUV JYOTI SHUKLA HAS GIVEN THE IDEA OF HOW TO FIND THE PRIME NUMBERS IN AN EFFICIENT WAY.
	   KARTHIK K HAS GIVEN THE CONCEPT OF ROTATING THE NUMBERS AND HOW TO USE THIS CONCEPT IN OUR PROGRAM.


INSTRUCTION TO RUN THE PROGRAM  :-

	ACTUALLY WE USED THE COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS IN OUR PROGRAM. AND BY THE HELP OF THIS WE CAN RUN 
	OUR PROGRAM IN THE CMD JUST BY TYPING THE FILENAME AND INPUT SEPARATED BY SPACE.
					
				EG:-  filename        input
				      Asn01P05   1193  



Details on example invocation and output :-

          For example, number 1193 is circular prime because all of its rotations 1931, 9311, 3119 are prime numbers.
		OUTPUT :- C:\Users\AVINASH\Desktop>Asn01P05 1193
			
			  The basic operation for this program is DIVISION.
			  132 steps are used for checking prime number.
			  4 rotation take place for given digit.
			  1193 is Circular prime.



CHALLENGES FACED :-

	INITIALLY ,OUR PROGRAM WAS SHOWING MANY ERRORS AND EVEN THE LOOP WAS NOT WORKING PROPERLY, 
	BUT LATER BY OUR CONTINUOUS EFFORTS WE MANAGE TO FIND THE SOLUTION BUT STILL OUR PROGRAM 
	HAD VERY MUCH TIME COMPLEXITY BECAUSE OUR PROGRAM WAS TAKING TOO MANY STEPS FOR CHECKING THE 
	CIRCULAR PRIME.

	BUT FINALLY BY THE HARD WORK OF OUR TEAM HELPED US TO REDUCING THE TIME COMPLEXITY OF OUR PROGRAM.


The Things we learnt from our assignment :-

        THIS PROGRAM HELPED US TO UNDERSTAND THE USE OF TIME COMPLEXITY AND WE ALSO SHARED EACH OTHERS IDEAS WHILE
	CREATING THE ALGORITHM.EVEN WE GOT TO KNOW HOW TO USE THE CMD TO RUN THE PROGRAM.
        
        AND MOST IMPORTANT THIS PROGRAM TEACHES US HOW TO WORK IN TEAM.
